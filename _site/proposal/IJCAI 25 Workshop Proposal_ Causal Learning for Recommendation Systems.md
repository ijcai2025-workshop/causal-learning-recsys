*IJCAI 25 Workshop Proposal: Causal Learning for Recommendation Systems*

### **Title: Causal Learning for Recommendation Systems**

### **Abstract**

This workshop will explore the intersection of causal learning and recommender systems, addressing key challenges such as bias, fairness, and interpretability. By moving beyond traditional correlation-based models, causal approaches provide a more robust framework for developing recommendation systems that better capture cause-effect relationships and offer personalized, equitable experiences. We invite researchers and practitioners to present novel ideas, methodologies, and practical applications that leverage causal learning to enhance the performance of recommendation systems.

### **Call for Contributions**

#### Introduction 

Recommendation systems are foundational to modern digital platforms, influencing user experiences across diverse domains such as e-commerce, social media, and streaming services. Despite their widespread use, traditional recommendation models predominantly rely on correlation-based learning, which can inadvertently lead to suboptimal, biased, or even unfair recommendations. In contrast, causal learning offers a paradigm shift, enabling the development of more reliable, equitable, and interpretable systems by explicitly modeling cause-effect relationships. By understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive user behavior, causal models hold the potential to unlock deeper insights and more personalized recommendations.

This workshop aims to bring together leading researchers and practitioners from the fields of machine learning, causal inference, and recommender systems to explore the promising intersection of causal learning and recommendation technologies. We invite contributions that showcase innovative approaches, cutting-edge research, and practical solutions, demonstrating how causal reasoning can address critical challenges such as bias, fairness, and interpretability in recommendation systems
